           <p>This quiz game is presented in a multiple question format.
                It consists of a landing page which prompts the user to choose categories, 
                start the game or view high scores list, 
                and when the game begins they must answer all the questions within the time limit, 
                which changes dynamically based on how many questions are in the set.
